# Car_Sales_Dashboard (Excel)

## üìå Project Overview
This project is an **interactive Excel dashboard** that analyzes car sales data.  
It uses **PivotTables, PivotCharts, calculated fields, and slicers** to provide insights into car prices, fuel distribution, engine categories, and manufacturer trends.  

## üìä Dataset 
**Source:** [Kaggle ‚Äì Mock Dataset of Car Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msnbehdani/mock-dataset-of-second-hand-car-sales)  
- **Fields included:** Manufacturer, Model, Engine Size, Fuel Type, Year of Manufacture, Mileage, Price  
- **Additional calculated fields added in Excel:**
  - **Engine Category** (Small, Medium, Large based on engine size)   
  - **Car Age** (based on year of manufacture)
  - **Age Category** (e.g., Mid-age, Old)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features of the Dashboard
- PivotTables for quick data summarization  
- PivotCharts (Bar charts, Pie charts) for visualization  
- Slicers for interactive filtering (Manufacturer, Fuel Type, Engine Category)  
- Separate sheets for raw data, pivot analysis, and final dashboard view
